<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Passionate about applying data-driven solutions to complex challenges, I completed my master's degree at Cornell University in August 2023, where my research focused on exploring the applications of machine learning and optimization methods in mechanical engineering. I developed mathematical models to solve intricate problems in biotechnology as a part of an NSF-supported project, while also developing automated tools to solve tedious image analysis tasks using computer vision methods.</p>

<p>Besides, I have been significantly struck by the recent advancement of generative AI, and I have delved into natural language processing and its application in generating educational content, employing transformer models to provide feedback on the effectiveness of an argument.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as a software developer at The Gene Box, where I developed a Django-based webapp that enabled users to access their genetic reports and recommendations online, and also contributed to the development of a machine learning model that predicted diseases based on the microbiome content of the user with over 90% accuracy. My work at The Gene Box allowed me to combine my technical skills with my curiosity and enthusiasm for genetics and health.</p>
